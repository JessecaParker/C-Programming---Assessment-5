# C-Programming---Assessment-5

In the first assignment, titled "u5a1 Part 1", the code inputs a date 
given by the user. With the custom function, 7 days are added to the date.
There are many else/if statements to account for the number of days in the
months, and if the date carries over to the new year. Then, it outputs
the new date.

In the second assignment, titled "u5a1 Part 2", the code gathers student 
ID numbers and their grades, stores them in an array, and then outputs them 
in chronological order. The grades stay with the ID numbers.
